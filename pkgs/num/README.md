# dash-num

This crate supplies the wide blob and arithmetic types used by the Dash Base SDK for consensus-stable types, including

* Fixed-width `HashBlob`s stored in little endian and rendered in big endian format for 160-bit (`Hash160`) and 256-bit
  width (`Hash256`)
* Unsigned 256-bit arithmetic (`Arith256`) with consensus-compatible behavior (e.g. wrapping operators)
* Compact representation of difficulty targets (`CompactTarget`) and bidirectional conversion with `Arith256`
