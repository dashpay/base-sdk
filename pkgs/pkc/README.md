# dash-pkc

This crate supplies the curve primitives for signing, verifying and encrypting used by the Dash Base SDK for
consensus-stable types, including

* Distinct byte bag and operative types to allow parsing _without_ pulling in crypto dependencies with native
  zeroization and constant-time comparison.
* A bug-compatible implementation of the sunset BLS12-381 scheme used by the reference implementation (also known as
  "legacy" or Chia scheme) and the current active (i.e. "basic") scheme.
* Shared DH secret derivation and encryption using BLS12-381's integrated encryption scheme.
* A consensus-compatible wrapper around secp256k1 with support for DER (en/de)coding, recoverable signatures and
  Bitcoin-derived compression semantics.
* Scalar and point tweaks for BLS12-381 and secp256k1

## Usage

To import `dash-pkc` to your project, add the following to the `[dependencies]` section in `Cargo.toml`

```toml
dash-pkc = "0.1.0-beta"
```

To use an unpublished revision of this crate, identify the commit hash to pin against and use the following replacing
the value of `rev`.

```toml
dash-pkc = { git = "https://github.com/dashpay/base-sdk", rev = "a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef" }
```

To build this crate on a clone of the repository, at the repository root, run the following

```bash
cargo build --package dash-pkc --all-features
```

## Features

This crate is `#![no_std]` + `alloc` by default.

| Feature | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `bls` | | Enables support for BLS12-381 operations backed by [`blst`](https://docs.rs/blst). Byte types are available without enabling this feature. |
| `codec` | :white_check_mark: | Enables support for encoding and decoding types using [`bitcoin-consensus-encoding`](https://docs.rs/bitcoin-consensus-encoding) |
| `ecdsa` | | Enables secp256k1 operations backed by [`rust-secp256k1`](https://docs.rs/secp256k1). Byte types are available without enabling this feature. |
| `eddsa` | | Enables ed25519 operations backed by [`ed25519-dalek`](https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek). Byte types are available without enabling this feature. |
| `full` | | Enables all features and `std` support. |
| `serde` | | Enables support for encoding and decoding `codec`-backed types using [`serde`](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde). _Implies `codec`._ |
