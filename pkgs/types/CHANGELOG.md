# Changelog

All notable changes to [`dash-types`](https://crates.io/crates/dash-types) and
[`dash-types-marker`](https://crates.io/crates/dash-types-marker) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this crate adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Implementation of `LowerHex`, `UpperHex`, `FromStr`, `From<&[u8; N]>` and `TryFrom<&[u8]>` for `{derive,make}_bytes!`.
- `ParseHexError` is moved from `dash-num`, superseding `dash_num::ParseHexError`.
- `serialize::hex::serialize_as` and `serialize::hex::deserialize_as`, to permit caller-defined handling of
  human-readable encoding while sharing common machine-readable encoding.

### Changed

- `{derive,make}_bytes!`-defined types serialize as their raw storage bytes for machine-readable formats. JSON and
  other human-readable formats retain hex in storage order for `fwd` and in reverse storage order for `rev`.
- `derive_bytes!` emits `From<[u8; N]>` in place of `impl_bytes!`, and `make_sbytes!` emits the implementation itself.
   Callers of `impl_bytes!` without `derive_bytes!` must now write the conversion manually.
  - As a result, both `make_bytes!` and `make_sbytes!` carry it with `nocodec` tag and without the `codec` feature and
    callers that wrote the conversion manually for those configurations must drop it.
- Types using `derive_bytes!` that implemented `From<&[u8; N]>`, `TryFrom<&[u8]>`, `FromStr`, `LowerHex` or `UpperHex`
  manually must drop those implementations, as `derive_bytes!` now emits them.
- `serialize::hex` writes raw bytes for machine-readable formats instead of emitting a hex-encoded string.
- `serialize::hex::deserialize` returns any `T` built from a byte slice instead of `Vec<u8>`. Callers that relied on
  `Vec<u8>` as the fixed return type must now mention it explicitly.
- `serialize::str_u64` writes a native `u64` to machine-readable formats. `str_u64` is a workaround for number-precision
  limitations in JSON and is now contained only for human-readable formats.

### Fixed

- `serialize::utf8_lossy`'s serializer and deserializer arms were not in sync, writing valid UTF-8 as a string for
  machine-readable formats but expecting byte buffers when reading, failing round trips. This has since been resolved.
