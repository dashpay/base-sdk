# dash-types

This crate supplies shared definitions and
[procedural macros](https://github.com/dashpay/base-sdk/tree/develop/pkgs/types/marker) that build the foundation
for the Base SDK's higher level types, including

* Support for Bitcoin-based consensus encoding (using [rust-bitcoin](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin)'s
  [`bitcoin-consensus-encoding`](https://docs.rs/bitcoin-consensus-encoding))
* Standardized `serde` formatting routines for common types (long integers, UTF-8 bytes, hex bytes)
* Growable (`Vec{De,En}coder`) and fixed sized (`Arr{De,En}coder`) codecs, fixed size buffers (`ArrayBuf`)
* Macro definitions to reduce routine boilerplate
* Name-stable programmatic identifiers (`TypeId`) for consensus types

| `codec` | :white_check_mark: | Enables support for encoding and decoding types using [`bitcoin-consensus-encoding`](https://docs.rs/bitcoin-consensus-encoding) |
| `full` | | Enables all features and `std` support. |
| `serde` | | Enables support for encoding and decoding `codec`-backed types using [`serde`](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde). _Implies `codec`._ |
